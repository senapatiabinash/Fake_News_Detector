Fake News Detection using Python for Data Science
Overview
This GitHub project aims to implement a Fake News Detection system using Python for data science. The project leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TfidfVectorizer along with the Passive Aggressive Classifier to build a robust and efficient model for identifying fake news.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Utilizes Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing, including handling missing values, text cleaning, and feature engineering.

Text Representation: Employs TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn to convert the textual data into a numerical format, preserving the importance of words in the corpus.

Machine Learning Model: Implements the Passive Aggressive Classifier from Scikit-learn to build a supervised learning model for classifying news articles as fake or genuine.

Evaluation Metrics: Incorporates relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the model.
